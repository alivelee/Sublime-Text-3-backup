Eightlime - Sublime 3 Theme
=============================================

Inspired by Modern (Metro) style in Windows 8.

**Note**: Currently there is only Dark theme. I will start working on Light theme if there are demands.

Installation
-------------------

**Download with Package Control**:

1. In Sublime 3, press CTRL + SHIFT + P

2. Type in "install" and select the "Package Control: Install Package"

3. Wait for a few sec and new popup will appear, search "eightlime" and select it.

**Setting up the Theme**:

1. Change the Editor color by going to: `Preferences > Color Scheme > Theme - Eightlime > Eightlime Dark`

2. Change the GUI by going to `Preferences > Setting - User`

It will open the setting text file. Add the following line:
    
    "theme": "Eightlime Dark.sublime-theme"

Overall, mine looks like this:

    {
      "color_scheme": "Packages/Theme - Eightlime/Eightlime Dark.tmTheme",
      "ignored_packages":
      [
        "Vintage"
      ],
      "theme": "Eightlime Dark.sublime-theme",
    }
